CHANGES for 0.5 again 2005/04/14 -------------------------------------------

* added some changes from Thomas Maeder
  e.g avoided isdigit because of possible buffer-overflow,
  further checks regarding string size ... and fixes for "no-trailing-null"
  Thanks for that.

CHANGES for 0.5 ------------------------------------------------------------

* Realized persistant arrays
* Added "keys"-option to get ALL keys from gdbm-file
* Added "-no_trailing_null-option" to gdbm_open
* gdbm_open without parameters returns all currently opened
  handles
* Removed bug with return-values from count/maxkey returned as
  TCL_STATIC (Thanks to Uwe Klein)
* Restructured code to be more maintainable :-)

* INCOMPATIBILITIES *
  - you shouldn't have relied on "gdbm_open" to print a usage
    information when called with no parameters, this must now
    be "gdbm_open -help"

CHANGES for 0.4 ------------------------------------------------------------

* The created library is renamed to tgdbm.dll because of some
  confusion with tclgdbm.dll.
* The tests uses the tcltest-package, instead of shipping the
  good old "defs"-file.
* Using tcl-stubs.
* The shared library is now splitted (even on windows) in two
  parts. The gdbm.dll (which should be the official windows-port
  in the near future) and the Tcl-Extension tgdbm.dll (which uses
  gdbm.dll).

* INCOMPATIBILITIES *
  - If you have used:
    package require gdbm

    you should change this to
    package require tgdbm
